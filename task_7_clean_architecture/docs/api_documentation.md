ðŸ“„ **Get started here** This document provides a comprehensive guide to using the Task Management API, including how to authenticate, manage tasks, and handle common scenarios.




## Overview of the Task Management API

The **Task Management API** provides a robust set of tools and resources that enable you to **programmatically manage tasks and user accounts**. This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as handling user registration and authentication.

## Getting Started Guide

To start using the Task Management API, you need to follow these essential steps:

1. **Understand Authentication**: All protected API endpoints require proper authentication using a JSON Web Token (JWT).
    
2. **Obtain a JWT**: After registering, you'll need to log in to receive a JWT as an `HttpOnly` cookie. This cookie will automatically be sent with subsequent requests to authenticated endpoints by most HTTP clients (like Postman or web browsers).
    
3. **Use HTTPS**: The API is designed to respond only to HTTPS-secured communications. Any requests sent via HTTP may be redirected. (Note: Your provided `router.go` runs on HTTP. For production, ensure HTTPS is configured.)
    
4. **JSON Format**: The API expects request bodies and returns responses primarily in JSON format. Ensure your `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json` for requests with a body.
    
5. **Error Handling**: When an API request returns an error, it is sent in the JSON response, typically with an `"error"` or `"message"` key, along with an appropriate HTTP status code.
    

## Authentication

The **Task Management API** uses **JWT (JSON Web Token) via HttpOnly cookies** for authentication.

### How to Authenticate:

1. **Register**: First, register a new user by sending a `POST` request to `/register` with your `email` and `password`.
    
    - **Endpoint**: `POST /register`
        
    - **Request Body**:
        
        JSON
        
        ```
        {
            "email": "your_email@example.com",
            "password": "your_strong_password"
        }
        ```
        
    - **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters, maximum 20 characters.
        
    - **Email Requirements**: Must be a valid email format.
        
2. **Log In**: After successful registration (or if you already have an account), log in by sending a `POST` request to `/login` with your `email` and `password`.
    
    - **Endpoint**: `POST /login`
        
    - **Request Body**:
        
        JSON
        
        ```
        {
            "email": "your_email@example.com",
            "password": "your_password"
        }
        ```
        
    - **Response**: A successful login will not return a JSON body, but it will set an `HttpOnly` cookie in your browser/client containing the JWT. This cookie is automatically managed by clients and sent with subsequent authenticated requests.
        

### Authentication Error Response

If a JWT cookie is missing, expired, or invalid, you will typically receive an **HTTP 401 Unauthorized** response code, and requests to protected endpoints will fail.

### Authorization (Roles)

The API supports two user roles: `USER` and `ADMIN`.

- **USER**: Can only manage (create, read, update, delete) tasks that they own. They can view their own user information.
    
- **ADMIN**: Can manage all tasks in the system (create, read, update, delete any task) and view any user's information.
    

The `Authorization` middleware (`middleware/user_auth.go`) handles checking if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform an action on a specific task (e.g., ensuring a `USER` only modifies their own tasks).

## Rate and Usage Limits

This API does not currently implement explicit rate limiting. However, it's good practice to design your client applications to be respectful of server resources. Unexpected spikes in traffic may lead to server instability.

### 503 Response

An HTTP **503 Service Unavailable** response from the server indicates an unexpected issue, possibly due to an unexpected spike in API access traffic or a temporary server outage. If you encounter a 503 error, please wait a few minutes and retry your request. If the outage persists or you receive any other form of an HTTP 5XX error, contact support.

## Need Some Help?

In case you have questions or encounter issues:

- **Review the Code**: Refer to the Go source code you provided for detailed implementation logic in `controllers/`, `models/`, `data/`, `infrastructure/`, and `middleware/`.
    
- **Check Server Logs**: The server outputs useful information to the console, including environment variable loading and database connection status. Errors are also logged.
    
- **Database Inspection**: If you have direct access to your MongoDB instance, you can inspect the `users` and `tasks` collections for data integrity.
